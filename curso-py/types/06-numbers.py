number = 2  # Integer
decimal = 2.3  # Float
imaginary = 2 + 2j  # 2+ 2i ("i" is the square root of -1)

# Basic operations

print(1 + 3)
print(1 - 3)
print(1 * 3)
print(1 / 3)
print(1 // 3)  # Gives us the integer value of the division
print(8 ** 3)  # Allows us to raise to the power indicated
print(8 % 3)  # Gives us the leftover value of the division

# Operations with variables

# number = number + 2 (Long way)
number += 2  # Short way, can be done with any operation
print("number", number)
